/*
problem: you have n coins each with ai value numbered from 1 to n each with a certain value and you want to start moving 
from left to right to give each coin weather to the first person or to the second person and after each assignment there
will be a difference between them i want to minminze the max difference between them.

Solution: by Dp we can move from the left to the right assigning and the state will be (cur_position,the_cur_balance) then when i return 
i will minminze on the answer and max with the previous state answer to return to the previous state with the min answer you can get.

code
----
const int N=109;
int a[N];
int n,mem[102][10002];
int solve(int id,int cnt){
 
    if(id==n+1){
        return cnt;
    }
    int &ret=mem[id][cnt];
    if(ret!=-1)
        return ret;
    int ans=cnt;
    ans=max(ans,min(solve(id+1,abs(cnt+a[id])),solve(id+1,abs(cnt-a[id]))));
    return ret=ans;
}
int main(){
    int T;
    scanf("%d",&T);
    while(T--){
        scanf("%d",&n);
        for(int i=1;i<=n;i++){
            scanf("%d",&a[i]);
        }
        clr(mem,-1);
        printf("%d\n",solve(1,0));
    }
}
