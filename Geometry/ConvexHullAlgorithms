Andrew's Algorithm
Problem: getting The convex hull of a set of points is the smallest convex polygon that surrounds the entire set.
Solution:  An efficient method that is often used in challenges is the Graham scan [2], which requires a sort by angle.
This isn’t as easy as it looks at first, since computing the actual angles is expensive and introduces problems with numeric
error. A simpler yet equally efficient algorithm is due to Andrew [1], and requires only a sort by X for a line sweep 
(although Andrew’s original paper sorts by Y and has a few optimizations I won’t discuss here).
Andrew’s algorithm splits the convex hull into two parts, the upper and lower hull. Usually these meet at the ends, but
if more than one points has minimal (or maximal) X coordinate, then they are joined by a vertical line segment. We’ll describe
just how to construct the upper hull; the lower hull can be constructed in similar fashion, and in fact can be built in the same loop.
To build the upper hull, we start with the point with minimal X coordinate, breaking ties by taking the largest Y coordinate.
After this, points are added in order of X coordinate (always taking the largest Y value when multiple points have the same X value).
Of course, sometimes this will cause the hull to become concave instead of convex:
okay we keep joining the current point with the one with nearest x-axis till we reach the last point then we will return and check the
last point with pervious point and preprevious point if they are convex or not if not then i will delete the previous point and so on
this to build the upper of the hull and the same for the down layer.

Graham scan algorithm
another algorithm gets the smallest convex polygon to contain all the given points.

Notes
it can be used to get just a simple (concave or convex ) polygon using all the given points.
