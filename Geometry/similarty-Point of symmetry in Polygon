Similarity between polyons:
source: https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Similarity_(geometry)

In Euclidean geometry, two objects are similar if they both have the same shape, or one has the same shape as the mirror image
of the other. More precisely, one can be obtained from the other by uniformly scaling (enlarging or reducing),
possibly with additional translation, rotation and reflection.

Point of symmetry in polygon (central point) :
Source: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcnIF6RUEw0

if the polygon have odd number of vertexes then there is no point of symmetry in that polygon,
point of symmetry occurs when there is a point in polygon which spilts it in two parts each part have a matching
part with the same distance from that point and in opposite direction, in other words for each vertex there is another
vertex opposite to it and the symmetry point is the mid point of it.

code to check if there is a symmetry point in a polygon or not. (points given in counter-clockwise) 
const int N=100000+9;
ll x[N],y[N];
int main(){
    int n;
    cin>>n;
    for(int i=0;i<n;i++){
        cin>>x[i]>>y[i];
    }
    if(n%2!=0){
        cout<<"there is no symmetry point\n";
        return 0;
    }
    ll px=(x[0]+x[n/2]),py=(y[0]+y[n/2]);
    for(int i=0;i<n/2;i++){
        int current_point=i;
        int opposite_point=i+n/2;

        if((y[current_point]+y[opposite_point]!=py)||(x[current_point]+x[opposite_point]!=px)){
            cout<<"there is no symmetry point\n";
            return 0;
        }

    }
    cout<<"there is symmetry point\n";
}
