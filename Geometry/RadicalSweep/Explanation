- Here is another kind of sweep which is the radical sweep which means that i will sweep in a circular motion using 2 paramters
the angle i sweep with and the length of the line i sweep with.
-Trick: you can sweep not with angle but with slope of line to avoid precision errors.

Example 1 
Problem: Maximum points that can be enclosed in a circle of given radius R
Solution 1 (with out line sweep just brudeforce) 
just pick any pair points and assume that one of them is the most left point in the circle that touches its circumfirance and the other
is the rightmost one but the distance between them must be at most 2*R and then check every other point whether it is inside the circle
or not and maxmimize for each circle. O( n^3 )

Solution 2 ( this is the line SweepSolution )
By using Angular Sweep, we can solve this problem in O((n^2)log n). The basic logical idea of this algorithm is described below.
We pick an arbitrary point P from the given set. We then rotate a circle with fixed-radius ‘R’ about the point P.
During the entire rotation P lies on the circumference of the circle and we maintain a count of the number of points 
in the circle at a given value of Θ where the parameter Θ determines the angle of rotation. The state of a circle can 
thus be determined by a single parameter Θ because the radius is fixed.
We can also see that the value of the count maintained will change only when a point from the set enters or exits the circle.

After this, the problem reduces to, how to maintain the value of count.
For any given point except P (say Q), we can easily calculate the value of Θ for which it enters the circle (Let it be α) and
the value of Θ for which it exits the circle (Let it be β).
We have angles A and B defined as under,
A is the angle between PQ and the X-Axis.
B is the angle between PC and PQ where C is the center of the circle.

A= tan-1( (p.y-Q.y)/(p.x-Q.x) )
B= cos-1 d/(2*R)   where d is the distance between p and Q.
and
α = A-B 
β = A+B
(Note: All angles are w.r.t. to X-Axis. Thus, it becomes ‘A-B’ and not ‘B-A’)
then
We can calculate angles A and B for all points excluding P. Once these angles are found, we sort them and then traverse them in 
increasing order. Now we maintain a counter which tells us how many points are inside the circle at a particular moment.
Count will change only when a point enters the circle or exits it. In case we find an entry angle we increase the counter by 1 
and in case we find an exit angle we decrease the counter by 1. The check that the angle is entry or exit can be easily realised 
using a flag.Proceeding like this, the counter always gives us a valid value for number of points inside the circle in a particular
state.
Important Note: The points which have ‘d’>2R do not have to be considered because they will never enter or exit the circle.
The angular sweep algorithm can be described as:
Calculate the distance between every pair of nC2 points and store them.
For an arbitrary point (say P), get the maximum number of points that can lie inside the circle rotated about P using the getPointsInside() function.
The maximum of all values returned will be the final answer.

Example 2 
Problem: getting the max number of points in a line
Solution 1: using map brudeforce solution 
We can solve above problem by following approach – For each point p, calculate its slope with other points and use a map to 
record how many points have same slope, by which we can find out how many points are on same line with p as their one point. 
For each point keep doing the same thing and update the maximum number of point count found so far.
Some things to note in implementation are:
1) if two point are (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) then their slope will be (y2 – y1) / (x2 – x1) which can be a double value and
can cause precision problems. To get rid of the precision problems, we treat slope as pair ((y2 – y1), (x2 – x1)) instead of ratio 
and reduce pair by their gcd before inserting into map. In below code points which are vertical or repeated are treated separately.

------------------------------------
Solution 2 : (using radical sweep) 
Pick any point P and loop on the rest points and calulate the angle between line from P to the ith point and P axis and store it
and then sort all of the angles and get the max number of times a certain angle exists this is the number of points.
