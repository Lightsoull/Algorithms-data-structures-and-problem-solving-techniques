Note
all equilateral polygons are convex but not all convex polygons are equilateral
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
First of all if in the problem he don't state the type of polygon so this means it can be any thing
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Polygon is a sequence of n points or corners ( n>=3 )
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Regular polygon
- all its sides are equal 
- all its angles are equal and each equal to ( ((n-2)*180)/n )
- if you have the radius of that polygon you can get the length of its side (radius of the polygon is half the length of its diameter 
which is the length of a stright line passing by the polygon center)
length of side = 2*(radius of polygon)*sin(180/n)
where n is the number of polygon sides.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- The total sum of angles of a polygon of n sides is (n-2)*180
- Polygon Implementation 
Don't forget the relation between the last point and the first point
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Simple Polygon   VS    Non-Simple Polygon
-----------------------------------------
- Simple Polygon
Don't have any intersections between the sides except for the neighbours sides which intersects at the courner
-Non-Simple Polygon
have any intersections between the sides and not for the neighbours sides which intersects at the courner

To know whether the polygon is simple or not 
1- brudeforce in O(n^2)
2- Line sweep in O( nlogn ) ( in Future yu will know it )

TakeCare
1- Don't check conscutive edges and the last edge and the first edge are conscutive
2- use CCW to test intersection

CODE

// assume that the first point is added to the end of vector of points so i have (n+1) points

bool isPolygonSimple(vector<point> &p)
{
    for(int i=0;i< sz(p)-1;i++)
    {
        for(int j=i+2;j< sz(p)-1;j++)
        {
            if(intersect(p[i],p[i+1],p[j],p[j+1])&&(i!=0||j!=sz(p)-2))
                return false;
        }
    }
    
    return true;
}
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Diagonals
-The number of diagonals in n sides polygon is n(n-3)/2
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Convex Polygon VS Concave Polygon
-Convex Polygon 
All interior angles are <=180 
A line drawn in the convex will intersect in at most 2 points
all its diagonals lies completely inside it

-Concave polygon 
No restriction on the interior angles
A line drawn in the concave may intersect in many points
all its diagonals lies completely inside it or not

Check for Convex Polygon BY CCW

// isConcave = !isConvex
// isConcave = 2 different signs
// here i assumed that there is no multiple points and there is no collinear points 
// there may be a case in which there is 100 points but all are collinear so there must be at least 3 points non-collinear
// all must have the same sign or zero
bool isConvexPolygon(vector<point> &p) 
{
        // all polygon 3 consecutive points must have same sign (ccw or cw)
        p.push_back(p[0]), p.push_back(p[1]); // wrap points for simplicity

        int sign = ccw(p[0], p[1], p[2]);
        bool ok = true;
        for (int i = 1; ok && i < sz(p) - 2; i++) 
        {
          if (ccw(p[i], p[i + 1], p[i + 2]) != sign)
            ok = false;
        }
        p.pop_back(), p.pop_back();
        return ok;
}
