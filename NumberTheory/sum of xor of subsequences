problem : given some array A of length n and we want to compute the sum of xor of all the subsequences of array A.
solution : for every bit i if there is at least one value in the array that have this bit equal to one then
this bit will present in the answer half the total number of subsequences and the total number of subsequences is (2^n)
so half the number of subsequences is (2^n)/2 = (2^(n-1) so we will add (2^(n-1)*(2^i) = (2^(n-1+i)).
