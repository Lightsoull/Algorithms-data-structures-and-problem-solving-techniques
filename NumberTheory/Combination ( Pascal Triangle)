1-if you want to calculate n choose k is c[n][k]
2- the idea based on (n choose k) = (n-1 choose k-1 ) + (n-1 choose k )
proof 
imagine 6 students and i want to chooose k student but the first one is choosen anyway so it is n-1 choose k-1
+
imagine that the first student is not allowed to be choosen at all so its n-1 choose k
-Notes
-c[r][c] means (r choose c). 
-sum of all elements in the rth row is (2^r) ,rows and columns are zero based.

code
// don't worry it works if k is > n 
void fun()
{
    for(int i=0;i<65;i++)
        for(int j=0;j<65;j++)
         comb[i][j]= (j==0 ? 1 : i==0 ? 0 : comb[i-1][j-1]+comb[i-1][j]);
}
