Problem: x1+x2+x3+x4=n, in how many ways the variables x1,x2,x3,x4 can be assigned to non-negative integers to result in n,
Solution: imagine the n is listed in ones (1 1 1 ...) then you will need to divide those ones on 4 partions one for each xi (i from 1 to 4)
so the number of ways to do so is (n+4-1 choose 4-1) choose means combination.
