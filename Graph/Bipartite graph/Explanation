Notes about the bipartite graphs
-A Tree is always can be expressed as a Bipartite graph 
-At the chess board the kight move in 2 steps in direction A then 1 step in direction B where A and B must be perpendicular 
to each other, so it always attack the colour which is the opposite to it so all the edges from it goes to the other colour and never 
goes to the same colour So the knight graph is a bipartite where the black cells are in a side and the white ones in the other side.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Bipartite graph check
Explanation: to check if the given graph is Bipartite or not move on its levels level by level and assign a colour for each level
opposite to the colour assigned to the pervious level because it is obvious that there is an edge between them so they have to in
opposite sides in the bipartite graph, then loop on all the edges if there is an edge from two same colour then the graph is not
bipartite else the graph is bipartite.

Max Cardinality Bipartite Matching (MCBM)
-Source: mostafa saad video Max bipartite matching/mostafa saad video maxflow2/ CP3 (4.7.4)
-Meaning: means the max matching of a bipartite graph.
Note 
the edges between the leftside and the rightside of the bipartite you have to put them to be
directed going from the left side to the right side, because the max matching doesn't care whether
the edge between the two nodes of the max matchings is from the left to right or opposite, but
i put them in that way because the algorithm getting the MCBM process in that way.

-How to get it ? there is two ways
1- construct the biparttite graph then put an extra node to be a source and connect it to the left side of the graph with weights inf
and put another extra node to the sink and connect the right side to the sink with weights equals to inf and the bipartite edges
should be of weight equals to one, then run maxflow algorithm the value of the maxflow is the result.

2- there is another faster way in O( N^2 ) where N is the number of nodes, i will move on the left side of the graph and try to match
every node, matching a node means that to find an augmenting path and why finding an augmenting path would let the node be matched 
because if i moved from a node A to node B if B already assigned to node C then by matching A to B, C have to find another one to go 
to since it no longer could go to A so i will move from C to E but if E goes to some node to this node have to search for someone else
to go to and so on, so i am moving in a path if it is ends at some node that could find someone else to go to then i can match the 
intial node i want to match, but if it couldn't find someone else to go to then i couldn't match the intial node.

Notes
1- it doesn't matter if the left side nodes names are from 1 to n and the right side is from 1 to m then there will be the same
node name in the left and right side, it is okay ,but put the edges from the left side to the right side only, why this is right
because when i match from left to right the right is will match to left by the L array so it is okay. bec i don't need any edges
except from the left to the right.

Min Vertex Cover (MVC)
-source: CP3 (4.7.4).
-Meaning: In a bipartite graph is the min number of nodes that let every edge to be covered in at least one node.
Note 
the edges between the leftside and the rightside of the bipartite you have to put them to be
directed going from the left side to the right side, because the max matching doesn't care whether
the edge between the two nodes of the max matchings is from the left to right or opposite, but
i put them in that way because the algorithm getting the MCBM process in that way.

-How to get them ?
MVC equals to MCBM
-How to print them ?
okay first since the MVC = MCBM then the MVC nodes must be only one of the two nodes in each matching, but could i know the exact nodes
okay, imagine a bipartite graph the left side A,C,D and the right side B,E if there is an edge(A,B) edge(C,B) edge(D,E) then if i
taked A and D as the MVC it will be wrong because B resonsible for A and C so edge(B,C) won't be covered which means if i tried to match
A and it doesn't match means that the node that i want to match to which is B is resonsible for other node which is C and C has no
other node to match to at that case i should choose B not A and not C.
implementation: for printing the MVC i will define visL and visR and R and L arrays and i will try to match every node in the left to
the right and then i will loop on the unmatched nodes from the left and go and try to match them the target from that is to mark the
nodes that can't find another node to match to by one and the other nodes that already matched will be equal to zero at the visL
and visR array.

Maxiumum Indepentant set (MIS)
-Source: CP3 (4.7.4)
-Meaning: is the max number of nodes in the bipartite graph that no 2 nodes of them having an edge in between.
Note 
the edges between the leftside and the rightside of the bipartite you have to put them to be
directed going from the left side to the right side, because the max matching doesn't care whether
the edge between the two nodes of the max matchings is from the left to right or opposite, but
i put them in that way because the algorithm getting the MCBM process in that way.

-How to get it?
MIS= Number of total nodes in the bipartite graph - MCBM.
-How to print it?
in the opposite way to print the MVC, if a node from the left side couldn't match which means visL equals to one then it is among the
MIS nodes and if a node from the right side could match which means visR equals to zero then it is among the MIS nodes.

Min Edge Cover: Min Number of edges To Cover every node at least one time in bipartite graph. 
-How to get that ?
Min Edge Cover= total nodes - MCBM.
-How to print them ?
the max matching edges are part of the min edge cover so i will mark both nodes of the max matching edge nodes as marked
but there may be extra edges must to be added to cover all the nodes so i will loop on all the edges if the edge connects two 
marked nodes so there is no need to add it else i will add it and mark the unmarked node.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Min Path Cover
-Source: mostafa saad video Max bipartite matching/mostafa saad video maxflow2(important).
-Note: The Following Solution iff the graph is DAG, if it is a general graph then it is NP-hard problem.
-Meaning: min path cover means the min number of edge-disjoint paths in the graph to cover all the nodes at least one time.
-How to get it in DAG?
suppose i have n nodes from 1 to n, you will put all the n nodes one the left side and another copy of the n nodes also from 1 to n 
in the rightside, then put the dirceted edges normally, by this way i can convert any DAG to bipartite graph then get the MCBM and
the MPC= n - MCBM.
- Proof for getting the MPC
the max matching try to match every node which means it tries to make a parent to it and the number of paths is the number
of nodes without parent to minmizing the number of paths you have to maxmize the number of nodes that have parent which
means the matched nodes, so this is how it relates to max matching.
-If you want to print the paths 
step 1: every node will have some Left matching and some right matching because there is a copy of the same node in both sides, 
so you can start from a node that has only one matching (left or right) and not marked, mark it and go to what it matches if 
it is on the left then go to the right of it then go to the right again and so on and keep marking all the nodes in the path untill
you meet some node without right or marked before here it would be the end of a path. and go again to step 1 to get the remaing paths.

Hopcroft–Karp Algorithm
algorithm for getting the max bipartite matching but in a better order O( E * sqrt(V) ), E for edges number and V for vertexes number.
which can be used to get the MIS,MVC,MPC and all the MCBM applications.
Source1: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/hopcroft-karp-algorithm-for-maximum-matching-set-2-implementation/
Source2: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hopcroft%E2%80%93Karp_algorithm#Augmenting_paths
Note
there is a difference between maximum and maximal 
maximal: is the maximum possible thing i could get at a certain stage but it is not necessary the final maximum result.
Maximum: is the final max result.

    return 0; 
} 
Note 
-If you want to print the MVC or MIS, run the algorithm and after getting all the max matchings just loop on all the left side nodes
and if it is not matched run can match function that stated before and sure you will have 2 vis arrays one for the left side and 
the other one for the right side and mark during the can match function normaly as stated before.
- And to print MPC same way as the ordinary one since i already have the matchings and the left and right arrays.
