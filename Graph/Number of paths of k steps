-Problem: getting the number of paths between two nodes of k steps where each step the node can go to another node including itself
if there is an edge between it and itself, so given n nodes and a matrix of edges nxn Aij = 1 if there is edge between node i and j
and Aij = 0 if there is no edge between i and j.

Solution: put the edges matrix to the power of k, then the result matrix Aij represent the number of paths of k steps between nodes
i and j.
